Problems Faced:
	1.  While scrapping, I initially tried to store all links in one list, and after each page removed duplicate links by converting 
	     the list to set then back to list. But, even this caused overflow and I wasn't able to extract all links.
	     So, I extracted 5 pages at a time, and wrote them on a txt file, and looped over like this.
	     Later, I cleaned that txt file to get the desired list of links of all the problems.
